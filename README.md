# SpeedRun
Hack for UofTHacks:

You probably want to work out to stay healthy and to get that body you want. Unfortunately, there are no short term rewards to doing so, which makes fitness not very fun, especially for those who are just starting to get fit. Yet, existing solutions do not seem to tackle this issue. Whatever your reasons are for not working out, we have a solution: Speed Run. Speed Run is a Smart watch-integrated Android Fitness App which brings the thrill of gaming to your daily run.

Run IRL towards the heart orbs and collect them to increase your time limit. Gather them all and advance to the next round. Explore streets that you never even knew existed.

In the meantime, the smart watch companion displays the distance as well as an arrow pointing to the next closest destination. With the watch companion, you wonâ€™t ever need to pull out your phone during the workout, because once you reach a checkpoint, your watch will vibrate and the next destination will be set automatically.

Rank up to show off just how huge your calves are. Try to get through the most rounds and share the results with your friends! Remember, don't get hit by a car or be stupid.
